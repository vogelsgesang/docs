.. _config_framework_checks:

=====================================
Enable framework specific code checks
=====================================

Go to `“Your projects” <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/projects>`_ and click on the settings symbol. In the sidebar, click on “Basics” and tag your project (e.g,. with "django", "django-1.8").

With the next analysis, all patterns with the respective tag will be added to the analysis. Whenever a new pattern with the same tag is added to our platform, it will automatically be included in your analysis. Of course, after we did a quality check.

Click `here <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns>`_ to get an overview of all available patterns and their  tags. Please note, that patterns with the tag `'generic' <https://www.quantifiedcode.com/app/patterns?query=generic>`_ will apply to Python in general and will always be applied to any analysis (unless you turn them off.)
